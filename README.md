# Supervised-Machine-Learning---Regression-and-Classification
The repository cosists of projects related to very basic machine learning tasks - linear regression, logistic regression and softmax. In each of the projects, I have tried to code all algorithms from scratch without relying on advanced libraries like sklearn. Although simple, they are quite comprehensive as well including concepts like gradient descent, cost function, polynomial regression, regularisation etc
